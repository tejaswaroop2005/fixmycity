# FixMyCity - Civic Complaint Reporting System

## Project Overview

FixMyCity is a simple full-stack web application that allows citizens to report civic problems like potholes, broken streetlights, garbage issues, and other community concerns. Government officials can then view these complaints and update their status.

This is a college-level project built with basic web technologies, focusing on functionality over fancy design.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- Plain HTML5
- CSS3 (no frameworks)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no libraries)

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Multer (for file uploads)
- bcrypt (for password hashing)

## Features

### For Citizens
- User registration and login
- Submit complaints with title, description, location, and optional photo
- View their own submitted complaints
- Track complaint status (pending, in-progress, resolved)
- See admin remarks on their complaints

### For Admins
- Separate admin login
- View all submitted complaints
- Update complaint status
- Add remarks to complaints
- See citizen information for each complaint
